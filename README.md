# Description
This repository was for Test 2, to demonstrate how to create issues and branches, work with different branches, as well as how to commit, merge, and pull from different branches. 

I did not realize that I was connected to my ArcOfDoom personal account on Eclipse on my PC until I had completed the first test case's branch. I don't yet know how to swap accounts within Eclipse, so I would like to apologize for that mistake.
